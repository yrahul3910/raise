# Change Log

## 2.5.0

* **Breaking change:** The `ifa` metric has been removed.

## 2.4.0

* Added `as_np` option to `DataLoader` methods.
* **Breaking change:** The `popt20` metric has been removed, and with it, the `add_data` method on the `Data` class has also been removed.

## 2.3.0

* Scott-Knott now also performs a bootstrap test.
* Added distribution metrics (Jensen-Shannon, Kullback-Leibler, SMAPE) in `raise_utils.metrics.dist`. Note that the values you get from these will likely differ from other implementations, because we use a k-nearest neighbor-based KDE. This will be improved in a future patch, and should currently be considered experimental.
* Bug fix in `KruskalWallis` when there was no significant difference between group means.
* `DataLoader` now has a `pd_kwargs` option that passes your options to `pd.read_csv`.

## 2.2.2

* Bug fix in Scott-Knott

## 2.2.1

* Bug fixes

## 2.2.0

* Fully moved to Keras 3--both TensorFlow and PyTorch backends are supported. JAX might work, but it is not officially
    supported.
* **Breaking change:** `raise_utils.learners.TextDeepLearner` has been removed.
* `KruskalWallis.pprint()` now returns a DataFrame of adjusted p-values, the best-performing group, and whether it is
    significantly different from the others.

## 2.1.4

* Bug fixes

## 2.1.3

* Bug fixes

## 2.1.2

* Bug fixes

## 2.1.0

* Added `KruskalWallis` class to `raise_utils.interpret`.
* Fixed installation issue.
* Add `EarlyStopping` to `FeedforwardDL`.
* Add `random` to `HPO` class.

## 2.0.3

* Useful debug info printed when data shape mismatch occurs.
* Add `HPO` class to add hyperopt and BOHB to `raise_utils.hyperparams`.

## 2.0.2

* Bug fix: `wfo` transform can fail in some multi-class cases.

## 2.0.1

* Bug fix: Added one-hot encoding support to the `wfo` transform.

## 2.0.0

* **Breaking change:** `DODGE.optimize` now returns a tuple of median results and best configuration.
* `DODGE` now has a `predict` function.
* `BinaryGHOST` now has a `n_runs` parameter.
* `BinaryGHOST.fit()` now returns the same values as `DODGE`.
* `BinaryGHOST` now has a `predict` function.
* `BinaryGHOST` now has a `smote` parameter.

## 1.6.3

* Added G-1 score and IFA (initial false alarm) to metrics (thanks [@HuyTu7](https://github.com/HuyTu7)!)
* Added `GHOST` and `BinaryGHOST` to `raise_utils.hyperparams`

## 1.6.2

* `DODGE` does not print the learners anymore
* `DODGE` prints out the median performance every run
* New `n_iters` option added to `DODGEInterpreter`

## 1.6.0
